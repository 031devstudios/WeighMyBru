This project is a headless scale at the moment with a webserver hosted on the ESP32-S3.
This scale was designed to be used in conjunction with GaggiMate.

## GaggiMate

At the moment, the current GaggiMate does not support WeighMyBru scale. I am still waiting on the PR to be merged with the origianl repo. Below is the link to the fork that supports WeighMyBru scale. It's up to date with the following commit `6a2241c`
I will make sure I keep it updated constantly.
